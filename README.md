An AI-powered application should include the following components:
LLM (recommend using Llama 3.3 on Workers AI), or an external LLM of your choice
Workflow / coordination (recommend using Workflows, Workers or Durable Objects)
User input via chat or voice (recommend using Pages or Realtime)
Memory or state

Build on the Cloudflare Platform
Workers
Build serverless applications and deploy instantly across the globe for exceptional performance, reliability, and scale.

AI Gateway
Observe and control your AI applications with caching, rate limiting, request retries, model fallback, and more.

Vectorize
Build full-stack AI applications with Vectorize, Cloudflare’s vector database. Adding Vectorize enables you to perform tasks such as semantic search, recommendations, anomaly detection or can be used to provide context and memory to an LLM.

Workers AI
Run machine learning models, powered by serverless GPUs, on Cloudflare's global network.

Workflows
Build stateful agents that guarantee executions, including automatic retries, persistent state that runs for minutes, hours, days, or weeks.
